In the programming task described, you focused on converting numbers between different bases, particularly from any given base to decimal (base 10) and vice versa. The program consists of multiple functions such as:

number2Int: Converts a string representation of a number in a given base to a decimal number by iterating through each digit, multiplying by the base raised to the appropriate power.
isNumber: Validates if the input string represents a valid number in the specified base.
int2Number: Converts a decimal number to a string representation in a specified target base.
equals: Compares two number strings to check if they are identical.
GetMaxValue: Finds the highest numerical value from the digits in a number string, used to determine the base.
Finally, you worked on test cases to ensure the program's correctness and adapted the Ex1Main function to fit the requirements.
